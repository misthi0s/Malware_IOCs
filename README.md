## Disclaimer
### Offensive Content
This repository contains IOCs that threat actors are currently using for distributing or communicating with malware. Some of these IOCs, particularly the URLs, may contain terminology that is extremely offensive or sexual in content. Since the threat actors can control their delivery endpoints, they can name files and URL paths to whatever they want. Some of them use offensive terminology either for shock value or to prevent their IOCs from being included in reports or feeds due to the graphic nature of them. In order to provide as much information on IOCs for these malware families, the graphic IOCs have <ins>not</ins> been excluded from this repository. **DISCRETION IS ADVISED. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.**

### Automatic Blocking
These IOCs (especially the domains) are not meant to be added to blocklists automatically and are instead meant to provide information to threat hunters and researchers. While they can be used as feeds for automatically blocking, they may be overly generic or contain false positives and may cause issues. I am not responsible for any issues that may arise from automatically blocking the content in this repository.
